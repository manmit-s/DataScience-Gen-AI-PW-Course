        "1. **What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**  \n",
        "   - Interpreted languages, such as Python, execute code line-by-line using an interpreter at runtime. This offers flexibility and ease of debugging, but generally results in slower performance.  \n",
        "   - Compiled languages, such as C++, are translated into machine code before execution, offering faster runtime at the cost of an extra compilation step.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Exception handling is a mechanism that allows a program to deal with unexpected errors during execution. Python provides structured constructs like try, except, else, and finally to manage exceptions and ensure the program remains stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "   - The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is logging in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Logging allows developers to record messages that describe the events of a program's execution. These logs help in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining the software, especially in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The __del__ method is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup tasks, although reliance on it is discouraged due to unpredictability in garbage collection timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Using import module imports the entire module, requiring the module name as a prefix to access its components.  \n",
        "   - Using from module import item allows direct access to a specific item from the module without using the module name.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**  \n",
        "   - You can write separate except blocks for different exceptions, or group them together in a tuple:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     try:\n",
        "         risky_operation()\n",

        "\n",
        "8. **What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**  \n",
        "   - The with statement ensures that resources like files are properly managed. It automatically opens and closes files, even if an error occurs during file operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**  \n",
        "   - Multithreading runs multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory space. It is suitable for I/O-bound operations.  \n",
        "   - Multiprocessing runs separate processes, each with its own memory, making it ideal for CPU-bound operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**  \n",
        "    - Logging provides insight into program execution, assists in debugging, captures runtime events, categorizes them by severity, and allows recording to various outputs such as console or file.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Python handles memory management through dynamic allocation, automatic garbage collection, and reference counting. This system ensures efficient use of memory and helps prevent memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Enclose the error-prone code within a try block.  \n",
        "    - Use except to catch and handle specific exceptions.  \n",
        "    - Optionally use else to define code that runs if no exceptions occur.  \n",
        "    - Use finally to specify cleanup actions that execute regardless of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Proper memory management ensures optimal performance, prevents memory leaks, and allows the program to make efficient use of system resources, especially in long-running or resource-intensive tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - The try block contains code that might raise an exception.  \n",
        "    - The except block defines how to respond if a specific exception occurs, allowing the program to continue or exit gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How does Python’s garbage collection system work?**  \n",
        "    - Python primarily uses reference counting to track objects. When no references to an object remain, it is destroyed. In addition, a cyclic garbage collector handles reference cycles that reference counting cannot resolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**  \n",
        "    - The else block is executed only when no exceptions occur in the try block. It helps separate error-handling logic from the code that should run when everything proceeds as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**  \n",
        "    - DEBUG – Detailed information, typically for developers  \n",
        "    - INFO – Confirmation that the program is working as expected  \n",
        "    - WARNING – An indication that something unexpected happened  \n",
        "    - ERROR – A serious problem that needs attention  \n",
        "    - CRITICAL – A severe error causing the program to stop\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**  \n",
        "    - os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the parent and is only available on Unix-like systems.  \n",
        "    - The multiprocessing module provides a portable way to create and manage separate processes, making it more flexible and robust for cross-platform use.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Closing a file releases system resources and ensures that all buffered data is written to disk. Not closing files can result in data loss, corruption, or file access issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**  \n",
        "    - read() reads the entire file content into a single string.  \n",
        "    - readline() reads one line at a time, which is useful for processing large files line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**  \n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**  \n",
        "    - The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as navigating the file system, creating directories, and handling file paths programmatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**  \n",
        "    - Challenges include circular references, memory leaks from native extensions, and the non-deterministic nature of object destruction and garbage collection timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**  \n",
        "    - To raise an exception manually, use the raise keyword followed by an appropriate exception type:\n",
        "      ```python\n",
        "      raise ValueError(\"Invalid input.\")\n",
        "      ```\n",

        "\n",
        "25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**  \n",
        "    - Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same process. It is particularly beneficial for I/O-bound tasks such as file operations or network requests, improving application responsiveness and efficiency.\n",
