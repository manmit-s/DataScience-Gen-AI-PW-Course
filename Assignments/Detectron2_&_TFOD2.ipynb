        "## Question 1: What is Detectron2 and how does it differ from previous object detection frameworks?\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research’s PyTorch-based library for object detection and segmentation. It improves upon the original Detectron (built on Caffe2) by offering:\n",
        "- Modular design with dataset registries and config system.\n",
        "- Support for state-of-the-art models (Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet, panoptic segmentation).\n",
        "- PyTorch integration for flexibility, speed, and interoperability.\n",
        "- Easier customization and extension compared to Caffe2-based frameworks.\n",

        "## Question 2: Explain the process and importance of data annotation when working with Detectron2.\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "Data annotation ensures the model learns accurate object boundaries and categories. Steps:\n",
        "- Define classes and annotation guidelines.\n",
        "- Use tools (LabelImg, CVAT, VGG Image Annotator) to draw bounding boxes or masks.\n",
        "- Validate annotations for consistency and balance.\n",
        "- Convert annotations to COCO JSON format (images, annotations, categories).\n",
        "Importance: High-quality annotations directly improve IoU and mAP, reducing noise and bias.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Question 3: Describe the steps involved in training a custom object detection model using Detectron2.\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "1. **Dataset preparation:** Annotate and convert to COCO format.  \n",
        "2. **Dataset registration:** Register dataset with `DatasetCatalog` and `MetadataCatalog`.  \n",
        "3. **Config setup:** Load base config, set dataset paths, num classes, hyperparameters.  \n",
        "4. **Weights initialization:** Use pretrained weights for faster convergence.  \n",
        "5. **Training:** Run `DefaultTrainer` with config.  \n",
        "6. **Evaluation:** Monitor metrics (AP, IoU) and adjust parameters.  \n",

        "\n",
        "## Question 4: What are evaluation curves in Detectron2, and how are metrics like mAP and IoU interpreted?\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "- **IoU (Intersection over Union):** Measures overlap between predicted and ground-truth boxes.  \n",
        "- **mAP (mean Average Precision):** Average precision across recall thresholds and classes.  \n",
        "- **Precision–Recall curves:** Show trade-off between precision and recall; area under curve relates to AP.  \n",
        "Interpretation: Higher IoU and mAP indicate better detection accuracy and localization.\n",
